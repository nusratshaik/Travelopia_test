DOCUMENTATION OF MY CODE
Note: I have added Bootstrap for adding additional feature nav items only to make page more beautiful. If Bootstrap should not be used then I can remove the Bootstrap and will keep the header only .(Please let me know).

Title Animation:
The title in the full-page component features a colourful animation. The text changes colours in a loop, creating a visually dynamic and engaging effect. This animation is implemented using CSS keyframes.

Colourful Alert Message:
The interactive alert triggered by clicking the "Click here" button is styled with a gradient background. The colours of the gradient change in a loop, adding vibrancy and capturing user attention. The alert also fades in for a smooth visual transition.

Code Quality and Modularity:
JavaScript Functions:
JavaScript functions are modularized for better code organization and readability. The showColourfulAlert function encapsulates the logic for displaying the colourful alert, promoting maintainability and ease of understanding.

Bootstrap Integration:
I have used Bootstrap for the navbar so that when the window size is reduced the nav items such as home, about, contact are replaced by an icon and on clicking the icon the nav items will be displayed.



Error Handling:
The code includes error handling to account for scenarios such as the absence of the "Click here" button. If the button is not found, an error message is logged to the console. This proactive approach aids in identifying and addressing potential issues during development.


Centered Title:
A title is positioned at the center of the component, appearing above the image and overlay. The title is styled to be visually striking, making it a focal point of the webpage. The positioning is responsive, ensuring it remains centered across various screen sizes.

Clickable Button:
A button with the label "Click here" is placed under the centered title. The button is styled to be visually appealing, encouraging user interaction. When clicked, it triggers a specific action, enhancing the overall user engagement.

Interactive Alert on Button Click:
Upon clicking the "Click here" button, an interactive alert is triggered, displaying a message that reads "Hello, World‚Äù.
