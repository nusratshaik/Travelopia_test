DOCUMENTATION OF MY CODE
Title Animation:
	The title in the full-page component features a colorful animation. The text changes colors in a loop, creating a visually dynamic and engaging effect. This animation is implemented using CSS keyframes.
Colorful Alert Message:
	The interactive alert triggered by clicking the "Click here" button is styled with a gradient background. The colors of the gradient change in a loop, adding vibrancy and capturing user attention. The alert also fades in for a smooth visual transition.
Header Transparency:
	The header has a transparent background with an alpha value, creating a translucent effect. This enhances the visual appeal of the header while maintaining readability. The transparency is achieved using RGBA color values in the CSS.
Code Quality and Modularity:
JavaScript Functions:
	JavaScript functions are modularized for better code organization and readability. The showColorfulAlert function encapsulates the logic for displaying the colorful alert, promoting maintainability and ease of understanding.
Bootstrap Integration:
	Bootstrap classes are used for styling the header and navigation, providing a clean and responsive design. The integration with Bootstrap ensures consistency and simplifies the styling process.
Error Handling:
	The code includes error handling to account for scenarios such as the absence of the "Click here" button. If the button is not found, an error message is logged to the console. This proactive approach aids in identifying and addressing potential issues during development.
Screen Reader Compatibility:
	The webpage is designed with accessibility in mind. Semantic HTML elements and proper labeling are used to ensure compatibility with screen readers, providing an inclusive user experience.
Testing Frameworks:
Jest and Cypress:
	The code is written with testing in mind. Jest and Cypress can be integrated for unit testing, end-to-end testing, and ensuring the robustness of the application.
Background Image Coverage:
	The webpage includes a dynamic full-page component with an image that covers the entire white space. This is achieved without setting the image size explicitly via CSS, ensuring a visually engaging and responsive design.
Optimized Image for Different Screen Sizes:
	The background image is optimized for various screen sizes using bootstrap. The responsive design ensures that the image maintains visual quality and adapts appropriately to different devices, providing an optimal user experience.
Centered Title:
	A title is positioned at the center of the component, appearing above the image and overlay. The title is styled to be visually striking, making it a focal point of the webpage. The positioning is responsive, ensuring it remains centered across various screen sizes.
Clickable Button:
	A button with the label "Click here" is placed under the centered title. The button is styled to be visually appealing, encouraging user interaction. When clicked, it triggers a specific action, enhancing the overall user engagement.
Interactive Alert on Button Click:
	Upon clicking the "Click here" button, an interactive alert is triggered, displaying a message that reads "Hello, World™". This feature adds an engaging and interactive element to the webpage, providing immediate feedback to the user.
Code Structure:
HTML (home.html):
	The HTML file defines the structure of the webpage, including the header, full-page component, and necessary elements. It links external stylesheets and scripts for styling and functionality.
CSS (style.css):
	The CSS file contains styles for the entire webpage, including the full-page component, background image, overlay, title, and button. It ensures responsive design and optimal visual presentation on various devices.
JavaScript (function.js):
	The JavaScript file contains functionality to handle button clicks. It uses event listeners to trigger the display of an interactive alert with the message "Hello, World™" when the "Click here" button is clicked. The alert is styled for a colorful and visually appealing presentation.
